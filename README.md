# Make A'Point

With a pandemic all around the world and social anxiety at an all time peak, we need a scheduling app to save us. To help us resist any social interaction, we have an app you can use online with a desktop or mobile device so you won't need to go in or even call to get an appointment. How does it work? Just go to https://team-project-wk15.herokuapp.com/ signup or log in and see available dates for you to schedule and you're all set for your appointment!
